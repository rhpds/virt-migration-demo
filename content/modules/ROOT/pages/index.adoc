= OpenShift Virtualization Migration Demo

This demo is geared for VMware administrators.

With this in mind, please use a minimum of OpenShift and Kubernetes terminology.
For example, avoid the use of the term *Pod*, as it can be confusing to VMware administrators unfamiliar with OpenShift.

**This demo is divided into two parts:**

1. xref:01-mtv-migration.adoc[VM Migration with the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization]
2. xref:02-ansible-migration.adoc[VM Migration with the Ansible Automation Platform]

Feel free to deliver both parts or choose the one that best fits your audience.

== Setting Up Your Environment

Prior to your demo, prepare your demo environment by simply logging into both the vCenter and OpenShift Console.
This limits the steps you need to take to complete the demonstration and reduces the likelihood of fumbling around with copy-paste with passwords.
